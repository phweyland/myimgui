The title is a bit misleading ...

Very interested in vkdt performances, especially on the development side, which is a gem and full of potential.

But, I feel limited with the design of the lighttable side and don't want to bother the author with wishes which
are not in line with its one goals.
So, I started from an empty imgui app and build step by step a lighttable according to my taste, stealing most of
the code of vkdt.
The difference is mainly in the usage of sqlite as a database to store image metadata (instead of local folder files).
The other main difference is not to do anything for development, but instead calling vkdt to generate thumbnails,
edit or export the images.
I've imported from darktable the information I'm interested in: rating, labels, tags, datetime and geotags.

Cheers
